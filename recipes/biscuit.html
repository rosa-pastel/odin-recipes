    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A great way to start your day if you're an early bird. You don't need to call your temp to get you
        breakfast at 5 am anymore!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sausage</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Biscuits</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grill the sausage. Be careful not to burn your foot on the grill!</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork.</li>
        <li>Cook the egg until cooked. Top it with shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>
            To serve, place the sausage and the egg on one of the biscuits and 
            cover with the other biscuit. Remove the biscuits before eating 
            though. It's healthier.
